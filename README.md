# cardano-tools


## Synopsis

A collection of helper scripts for working on Cardano blockchain nodes


## Description

The cardano-cli program available on systems running a Cardano node is a very
powerful but low-level tool. Issues include a combination of repetitive
required switches and the need to execute multiple commands sequentially to
achieve basic tasks (like building, signing, and submitting a transaction).
This makes the use of helper scripts attractive in this space.

This project is a growing collection of helper scripts for doing Cardano node
work.
